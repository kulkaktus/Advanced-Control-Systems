function options = condesopt (varargin)
%
%   condesopt returns the default option sets for the CONDES command.
%
%   options=condesopt('Option1',Value1,'Option2',Value2,...)
%
%   The supporting options are:
%
%   'w' :       A vector of frequency points at which the constraints are evaluated. 
%               It can be a cell if different vectors are to be considered for 
%               different models in multimodel setting. In this case, w{i} is a vector 
%               of frequency points of model G{i}. The default value for LTI models is the
%               frequency vector given by the BODE command. 
%
%   'F' :       This is a weighting filter for L-Ld. For almost all
%               optimization problems an approximation of the two norm of 
%               F(L-Ld) is minimized. Its value is 1/(1+Ld) by default. F
%               should be set to tf(1) if no filter is desired.
%
%   'nq':       is an integer greater than 2 representing the number of vertices 
%               of a polygon that circumscribes the frequency domain model uncertainty 
%               circle in the Nyquist plot. If it is empty, the circle will not be approximated 
%               by a polygon and therefore a convex constraint is defined. In this case 
%               YALMIP interface should be used with a convex optimization solver 
%               (instead of LINPROG or QUADPROG).    
%
%   'lambda':   This option is used only for 'Hinf' performance. 
%               It indicates the sum of which weighted sensitivity functions should be 
%               less than 1. For example [1 1 0 0] means that the infinity norm of 
%               |W{1}S|+|W{2}T|, W{3}KS and W{4}GS will be less than 1  
%
%   'gamma':    This option is used only for 'Hinf' performance, when the infinity norm 
%               of the following vector should be minimized:
% 
%                   Lambda_1 |W{1}S|+Lambda_2|W{2}T|+Lambda_3|W{3}KS|+Lambda_4|W{4}GS|
% 
%               by a bisection algorithm. If all elements of Lambda are zero then
%               gamma is defined as an upper bound for all weighted sensitivity functions 
%               and will be minimized. For multimodel case the
%               maximum of gamma{i} is minimized for all models.'gamma' is a 
%               vector containing [g_min, g_max, tol, n_it] where g_min and g_max 
%               are the minimum and maximum value of gamma, tol is a small positive
%               number that indicates the tolerance of optimal gamma and
%               n_it is the number of times the bisection algorithm should
%               be performed with an updated Ld.
% 
%   'np':       This option is used if a gain-scheduled controller should
%               be designed. 'np' is a vector that indicates the degree of 
%               polynomials describing the gain-scheduled controller parameters.
%               For example np=[2 1] indicates that we have two scheduling
%               parameters. The first one is described by a second-order polynomial 
%               and the second one is linear.
%
%   'gs':       This option is used if a gain-scheduled controller should
%               be designed. 'gs' is a m by n matrix, where n is the number 
%               of scheduling parameters and m the number of operating points.
%               The i-th row of 'gs' contains the values of n scheduling
%               parameters that corresponds to the i-th model G{i}.
%
%   'Gbands':   This option is used only for MIMO controller design. It
%               indicates whether the Gershgorin bands should be used for 
%               MIMO stability guarantee or not. Using Gershgorin bands implies
%               the use of an SDP solver and YALMIP. If this option turned
%               to 'off', LINPROG or QUADPROG will be used for optimization
%               but the stability should be verified a posteriori.
%
%   'yalmip':   is a string that can be set to 'on' to activate the YALMIP
%               interface. It should be activated when nq=[] and/or
%               Gbands='on' for multivariable controller design. SDPT3 is
%               used as the default solver but can be changed by 'solver'
%               option, e.g.
%               options=condesopt('yalmip','on','solver','sedumi').
%
%
%  The options related to the optimization problem solvers can be assigned 
%  with this command as well. For example, if for the control problem in hand 
%  uses the linear programming solver LINPROG, condesopt('MaxIter',100)
%  passes the number 100 for maximum iteration to the options of LINPROG
%  solver.
%
%


%
%   'beta':     This option can be used only for 'GPhC' performance
%               specification and indicates the angle of line d2 with real 
%               axis in degrees. The default value 45-Phm/2 is used when
%               beta is empty.
